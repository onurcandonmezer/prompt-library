template: |
  Extract all action items from the following text.

  Context: {context}
  Output format: {output_format}

  Text:
  {text}

  For each action item, extract:
  - **ID** - Sequential identifier (AI-001, AI-002, etc.)
  - **Action** - Clear, specific description of what needs to be done
  - **Owner** - Person responsible (name or role, "Unassigned" if not specified)
  - **Deadline** - Due date or timeframe ("ASAP", specific date, or "Not specified")
  - **Priority** - High / Medium / Low (inferred from language and context)
  - **Status** - New / In Progress / Blocked / Completed (inferred from context)
  - **Dependencies** - Other action items or external factors this depends on
  - **Source quote** - The original text that implies this action item

  Detection rules:
  - Look for imperative verbs: "send", "create", "review", "schedule", "follow up"
  - Look for commitment phrases: "I'll", "we need to", "please", "make sure to"
  - Look for assignment patterns: "[person] will", "[person] to", "assigned to [person]"
  - Look for deadline indicators: "by Friday", "before the meeting", "this week"
  - Distinguish between action items and informational statements
