      feedback: "Overall I like the product - it does what it promises. The recent UI update made things easier to find. However, I've had to contact support three times this month, and wait times are getting longer each time. Pricing is fair for what you get. I renewed my annual plan but almost didn't because of the support experience. Would be great if you added Slack integration."
