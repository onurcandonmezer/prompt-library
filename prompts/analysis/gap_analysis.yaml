description: "Identify and analyze gaps between current state and desired state with actionable bridging strategies"
template: |
  Perform a gap analysis comparing the current state to the desired state.

  Area of focus: {focus_area}
  Priority framework: {priority}

  Current State:
  {current_state}

  Desired State:
  {desired_state}

  Provide your gap analysis:

  ## Gap Inventory
  | Gap Area | Current State | Desired State | Gap Size | Priority |
  |----------|--------------|---------------|----------|----------|

  Rate gap size as: Small / Medium / Large / Critical
  Rate priority as: P1 (Urgent) / P2 (High) / P3 (Medium) / P4 (Low)

  ## Detailed Gap Assessment
  For each significant gap:
  - **Description** - What specifically is missing or insufficient
  - **Root Cause** - Why this gap exists
  - **Impact of Gap** - Consequences of not closing this gap
  - **Resources Needed** - What is required to bridge the gap
  - **Estimated Effort** - Time and cost to close

  ## Bridging Strategy
  - **Quick Wins** - Gaps that can be closed immediately with minimal effort
  - **Short-Term Actions** (0-3 months) - Priority actions
  - **Medium-Term Initiatives** (3-12 months) - Planned improvements
  - **Long-Term Investments** (12+ months) - Strategic changes

  ## Risk of Inaction
  What happens if these gaps remain unaddressed?
