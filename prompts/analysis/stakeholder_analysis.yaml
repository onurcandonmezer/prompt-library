  - **High Power, Low Interest** (Keep Satisfied) - Influential but disengaged
  - **Low Power, High Interest** (Keep Informed) - Interested but limited influence
  - **Low Power, Low Interest** (Monitor) - Minimal attention needed

  For each key stakeholder:
  - **Current relationship** - Where things stand
  - **Desired relationship** - Where you need it to be
  - **Key concerns** - What they care about most
  - **Communication approach** - How and when to engage
  - **Win strategy** - How to gain or maintain their support
