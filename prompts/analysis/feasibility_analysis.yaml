template: |
  Assess the feasibility of the following project or initiative.

  Project: {project}
  Assessment scope: {scope}
  Decision deadline: {deadline}

  Project details:
  {details}

  Evaluate feasibility across these dimensions:

  ## Technical Feasibility
  - Can this be built/implemented with available technology?
  - What technical skills are required vs. available?
  - Are there proven solutions or is this novel?
  - Technical risk level: Low / Medium / High

  ## Financial Feasibility
  - Estimated cost vs. available budget
  - Expected ROI or payback period
  - Funding requirements and sources
  - Financial risk level: Low / Medium / High

  ## Operational Feasibility
  - Does this fit within current operations?
  - Organizational readiness and change management needs
  - Resource availability (people, equipment, facilities)
  - Operational risk level: Low / Medium / High

  ## Schedule Feasibility
  - Can this be completed in the proposed timeline?
  - Key milestones and dependencies
  - Schedule risk level: Low / Medium / High

  ## Overall Feasibility Assessment
  - **Feasibility Score** - 1 (Not Feasible) to 10 (Highly Feasible)
  - **Recommendation** - Proceed / Proceed with conditions / Delay / Do not proceed
  - **Critical Success Factors** - What must go right
  - **Deal Breakers** - What would make this infeasible
  - **Alternatives Considered** - Other approaches if this is not feasible
