template: |
  Create a comparison summary between the following items.

  Items to compare: {item_a} vs {item_b}
  Comparison criteria: {criteria}
  Perspective: {perspective}

  Information:
  {content}

  Structure your comparison as:
  1. **Overview** - Brief introduction of both items
  2. **Side-by-Side Comparison** - Key differences organized by criteria
  3. **Strengths** - What each item does best
  4. **Weaknesses** - Where each item falls short
  5. **Use Case Fit** - Who or what scenario each item is best for
  6. **Verdict** - Balanced conclusion with context-dependent recommendation

  Be objective and evidence-based. Avoid bias toward either item.
  Present trade-offs clearly so the reader can make their own informed decision.
